## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

Imagine a bustling coffee shop where customers are placing their orders for their favorite coffee drinks. The cafe owner, **Sheeren**, wants to efficiently manage the queue of coffee orders using a digital system. You are tasked with creating a program to handle this **queue of orders**.

Each character in the queue represents a customer's coffee order:

* `'L'` â†’ Latte
* `'E'` â†’ Espresso
* `'M'` â†’ Macchiato
* `'O'` â†’ Iced Coffee
* `'N'` â†’ Nabob

The system should support the following operations:

---

## ðŸ”¢ Input Format

* The input consists of **menu-driven choices**:

  1. **Enqueue** a coffee order
     â†’ Next line will have one character `'L'`, `'E'`, `'M'`, `'O'`, or `'N'`
  2. **Dequeue** the first coffee order
  3. **Display** all orders in the queue
  4. **Exit** the program

---

## ðŸ–¨ Output Format

* Based on the user's choice:

  * Enqueue:

    ```
    Order for X is enqueued.
    ```

    or

    ```
    Queue is full. Cannot enqueue more orders.
    ```

  * Dequeue:

    ```
    Dequeued Order: X
    ```

    or

    ```
    No orders in the queue.
    ```

  * Display:

    ```
    Orders in the queue are: X Y Z ...
    ```

    or

    ```
    Queue is empty. No orders available.
    ```

  * Exit:

    ```
    Exiting program
    ```

  * Invalid:

    ```
    Invalid option.
    ```

---

## ðŸ“Ž Constraints

* Maximum queue size = **5**
* Allowed coffee order characters: `'L'`, `'E'`, `'M'`, `'O'`, `'N'`

## ðŸ’» Java Code Implementation
